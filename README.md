TeamTreehouse Unit 4 Project

This application presents a game called *Phrase Hunter*. Upon starting the game, a phrase is hidden from the player. The player must choose letters on the webpage in order to correctly guess the hidden phrase. Upon 5 incorrect guesses, the players loses and may choose to play again. Upon fully revealing the hidden phrase, the player wins and may choose to play again.
- Added functionality so player may use physical keyboard instead of on-display keyboard to play the game.
- Added and styled an in-game message for players when they guess correctly or incorrectly.
